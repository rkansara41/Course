2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms

A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by

-Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
-Solving the sub-problems,
-Combining them to get the desired output.

The complexity of the divide and conquer algorithm is calculated using the master theorem.

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),
where,
n = size of input
a = number of subproblems in the recursion
n/b = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed to have the same size.
f(n) = cost of the work done outside the recursive call, which includes the cost of dividing the problem and cost of merging the solutions
